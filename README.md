# üìú NVIDIA DLSS Enabler Helper App

This is a desktop application that provides a graphical interface to easily enable and configure hidden NVIDIA DLSS features, such as Frame Generation (FG) and Ray Reconstruction (RR). The tool safely edits the ApplicationStorage.json configuration file of the "NVIDIA App," creating automatic backups and allowing changes to be restored. It facilitates the activation of these technologies in compatible games and applications that do not expose them in their menus, all through a user-friendly interface. Only compatible with series 30, 40, and 50. In the 30 series, only DLAA and other sections are enabled; frame generation is not activated. In the 40 and 50 series, everything is activated.

## NVIDIA DLSS Enabler Helper App

This application helps you adjust the NVIDIA DLSS features for your games by editing the **`ApplicationStorage.json`** master file used by the **NVIDIA App**. üéÆ‚öôÔ∏è

### Requirements

You need to have the [NVIDIA App](https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/software/nvidia-app/) installed and have launched it at least once to generate your configuration. Afterwards, you can return here and use the tools. üöÄ

### Origin and Motivation

This program was inspired by the Reddit discussion: [How to enable DLSS overrides in NVIDIA App](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ie7l1u/psa_how_to_enable_dlss_overrides_in_nvidia_app_on/?share_id=YcBEn_3x6IQM5MxTVu6Ja). üîó

I applied this method in my own game with an **RTX 3060**, and seeing the good results, I decided to share this tool. This project was born as a side quest, as I am focused on another larger, time-consuming project, and this was a relatively simple tool to develop. The application simplifies the process and includes restore options in case you don't like a change.

*A friendly reminder: please don't over-stress your GPU, drink water, and see you soon with more apps and mods!*

### Compatibility

The application is compatible with NVIDIA's 30, 40, and 50 series cards.

* **30 Series**: DLAA and other optimizations are enabled. Frame Generation is not activated on this series. It has been tested on multiple cards of this generation without any issues.
* **40 and 50 Series**: Full functionality is activated, including Frame Generation.

### Acknowledgements
