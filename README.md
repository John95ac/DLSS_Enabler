This is a desktop application that provides a graphical interface to easily enable and configure hidden NVIDIA DLSS features, such as Frame Generation (FG) and Ray Reconstruction (RR). The tool safely edits the ApplicationStorage.json configuration file of the "NVIDIA App," creating automatic backups and allowing changes to be restored. It facilitates the activation of these technologies in compatible games and applications that do not expose them in their menus, all through a user-friendly interface. Only compatible with series 30, 40, and 50. In the 30 series, only DLAA and other sections are enabled; frame generation is not activated. In the 40 and 50 series, everything is activated.
