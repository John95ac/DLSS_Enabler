[Advice]
Advice001 = This app edits the master file *ApplicationStorage.json* from *NVIDIA App* to enable/force *DLSS* technologies.
Advice002 = Before using it, install the *[NVIDIA App](https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/software/nvidia-app/)*
Advice003 = Useful only for *NVIDIA GPUs* in the *30*, *40* and *50* series. On *30-series*, *Frame Generation* is NOT available (other *DLSS* features still are). 
Advice004 = *"Smooth Movement" (RR)* is available on *40-* and *50-series*, with it, games can feel much smoother. \n \n Unfortunately I have an RTX 3060 so I don't have it on my card yet.
Advice005 = Use the *Safe Changes* button to save safely: it makes a *backup* first, then writes to a temporary file and replaces the original only when everything is OK.
Advice006 = When saving, the app removes *Read-Only*, writes, and then re-applies *Read-Only* to protect the file.
Advice007 = For changes to take effect, *reboot your PC* and then open *NVIDIA App* to verify.
Advice008 = The *Read Only* button toggles the file's *read-only* attribute. Disable to edit, re-enable when finished.
Advice009 = In the applications list, *double-click* a game to toggle *all overrides* (*DLSS* on/off) for that profile.
Advice010 = The *JSON Restore* tab lets you view *backups* and restore them. The *green* button restores the *selected backup*.
Advice011 = The *blue* "*Restore to Original Mode*" restores the *oldest backup* and leaves the master *NOT read-only*.
Advice012 = The *backups list* *auto-refreshes* when you add or remove files in *Data/backup/*.
Advice013 = Use *Export JSON* to copy the master to your *Downloads* with the *original name* and open the folder.
Advice014 = If *NVIDIA App* is open, it may block *saving* or *read-only* changes. Close *NVIDIA App*.
Advice015 = If something fails, check *write permissions* on the *master path* and *Data/backup/*, then try saving again.
